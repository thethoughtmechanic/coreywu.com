Edge Case 1: The Vertical Axis (T = 0, V ≠ 0)
High Collective (T = 0, V > 0)
Title: "The Conscious Equilibrist"
Between Augmented Harmony & Neo-Tribalism
You've found the razor's edge—neither rejecting technology nor embracing it, but consciously choosing moment by moment based on collective benefit. You're the rare individual who can code-switch between digital and analog worlds without losing your center.
Your future is one of deliberate balance. Communities hire you as a "Pace Mediator"—someone who can speak both languages and design hybrid solutions. You create "gradient zones" where high-tech and low-tech communities interface without conflict.
Your Strength: Translating between accelerated and grounded worldviews
Your Challenge: Avoiding paralysis in the face of constant choice
Your Role: Bridge between worlds, interpreter of possibilities

High Individual (T = 0, V < 0)
Title: "The Selective Optimizer"
Between Digital Darwinism & Sovereign Minimalism
You treat technology like a master chef treats ingredients—selecting only what serves your personal goals, discarding the rest. Neither luddite nor technophile, you're ruthlessly pragmatic about what earns space in your life.
Your future is perfectly curated. You might use AI for complex decisions but journal by hand. You'll upgrade your brain-computer interface while maintaining a flip phone. Every choice is intentional, nothing is default.
Your Strength: Immunity to both FOMO and technophobia
Your Challenge: Missing synergies that come from full commitment
Your Role: Curator of personal technological boundaries

Edge Case 2: The Horizontal Axis (T ≠ 0, V = 0)
High Tech (T > 0, V = 0)
Title: "The Pragmatic Augmentist"
Between Augmented Harmony & Digital Darwinism
You embrace technology without ideology. Neither saving the world nor optimizing just yourself, you see AI and human enhancement as inevitable tools to be wielded wisely. You're equally comfortable building community platforms or personal productivity systems.
Your future is one of practical experimentation. You'll test brain implants not for transcendence but for utility. You'll use AI not for revolution but for incremental improvement. Progress without philosophy.
Your Strength: Implementing technology without emotional attachment
Your Challenge: Finding deeper purpose beyond efficiency
Your Role: Builder of functional futures

Low Tech (T < 0, V = 0)
Title: "The Mindful Abstainer"
Between Neo-Tribalism & Sovereign Minimalism
You've stepped back from the digital rush not out of fear or ideology, but from a place of conscious choice. You're neither building communes nor living off-grid—just maintaining healthy distance from the acceleration.
Your future involves strategic disengagement. You might work in tech but live analog. You understand both worlds but choose presence over connectivity, depth over speed. You're the calm in the storm.
Your Strength: Clarity unclouded by digital noise
Your Challenge: Staying relevant without losing your grounding
Your Role: Keeper of human-pace wisdom

Edge Case 3: The Center Point (T = 0, V = 0)
Perfect Center (T = 0, V = 0)
Title: "The Adaptive Centrist"
The Fulcrum of All Futures
You are the rare individual who holds perfect neutrality—not from indecision, but from profound flexibility. You can shift into any quadrant as circumstances demand, understanding that rigidity is the enemy of survival in rapidly changing times.
Your future is radically contextual. In crisis, you might become highly collective. When exploring, you might go full tech. You're water, taking the shape of whatever container serves the moment while maintaining your essential nature.
Your Strength: Ultimate adaptability without losing core identity
Your Challenge: Avoiding drift into permanent uncertainty
Your Role: The wild card that could tip any future
Special Message for Centrists:
"Your position at the center isn't indecision—it's potential energy. In the game ahead, you'll be the swing vote, the tie-breaker, the one who can see all perspectives. Use this power wisely. The future may depend on your ability to move fluidly between worlds while helping others find their own balance."

Universal Edge Case Message:
"You've landed on a boundary—neither fully here nor there. This liminal space is both challenging and powerful. While others have clear quadrants to defend, you have the gift of perspective. In the coming game, you'll need to help others see beyond their positions while finding your own moments of commitment. Remember: sometimes the edge is exactly where we need to be."
