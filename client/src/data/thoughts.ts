    fullDescription: "We glorify creativity as the pinnacle of human value—but what if it's just ego at work?\n\nAll possibilities already exist. What we call creativity or invention is simply the discovery of a subset we hadn't yet uncovered.\n\nIn the age of AI, this illusion becomes clearer. Machines can explore possibility spaces far beyond us, dissolving the myth of creativity as a sacred human trait.\n\nInstead of clinging to the romance of \"generating,\" maybe the real choice is this: apply discoveries (human or machine) to drive real change—or indulge in creativity as entertainment.",

It should bring people together, strengthen local businesses, and make community the true amenity.",

Too easy and you're bored, too hard and you're anxious.\n\nAI promises to reduce complexity and improve our lives. But it may just as easily generate problems so intricate that we need AI to guide us through them. We risk shifting into intern mode—not leveraging technology, but being leveraged by it.\n\nThe flow window is shrinking. More and more, tasks are either trivial (repetitive work AI completes instantly) or out of reach (complex work where AI is the only true expert in the room).\n\nIn that narrowing gap, human meaning becomes harder to find.",

I shaped the direction, coordinated the process, executed the details. But in the end, it still felt like commodity work—like something anyone (or anything) could do. The ego hit is real: I'm not the creator in the spotlight anymore, just the caretaker behind the curtain.\n\nAnd maybe that's the deeper shift AI brings. It isn't just about productivity or skill—it's about the death of the hero's journey. Are we no longer the heroes of our own stories, but a supporting role in someone else's function?",
