Real estate as a community platform, weaving residents into the city rather than isolating them inside four walls.\n\nWhen a building joins a neighborhood, it should connect, not isolate. It should bring people together, strengthen local businesses, and make community the true amenity.",

Pessimists see rushed deployments as existential risks—one bad AI launch undermines decades of progress.\n\nShort-term, reversible decisions favour Type 1 tolerance (try fast, fail fast). Long-term, irreversible ones favour Type 2 tolerance (genetic modifications, climate interventions can't be easily undone).\n\nThe question isn't which error type to avoid, but developing better mechanisms to adjust our tolerance based on context, stakes, and reversibility.",

    fullDescription: "What if flow is one of the deepest sources of human meaning—that sweet spot where challenges match your skills? Too easy and you're bored, too hard and you're anxious.\n\nAI promises to reduce complexity and improve our lives. But it may just as easily generate problems so intricate that we need AI to guide us through them. We risk shifting into intern mode—not leveraging technology, but being leveraged by it.\n\nThe flow window is shrinking. More and more, tasks are either trivial (repetitive work AI completes instantly) or out of reach (complex work where AI is the only true expert in the room).\n\nIn that narrowing gap, human meaning becomes harder to find.",

    fullDescription: "The other day a colleague asked me, \"Did AI make that?\"\nAnd honestly—it stung.\n\nYes, I led the vision. I shaped the direction, coordinated the process, executed the details. But in the end, it still felt like commodity work—like something anyone (or anything) could do. The ego hit is real: I'm not the creator in the spotlight anymore, just the caretaker behind the curtain.\n\nAnd maybe that's the deeper shift AI brings. It isn't just about productivity or skill—it's about the death of the hero's journey. Are we no longer the heroes of our own stories, but a supporting role in someone else's function?",
